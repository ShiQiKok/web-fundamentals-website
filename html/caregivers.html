    <h2>Caregiver</h2>
        <hr>
    <p>When someone around you is diagnosed with a mental health disorder, you can 
        be a caregiver who helps and supports him/her with love and understanding. 
        The caregiver plays a crucial role, which makes those with the condition 
        feel they are not alone. We need to realize that the situations of mental 
        illness do not only affect individuals but also their family members, 
        friends, neighbors, coworkers, and others in the community.
        <br>
        The very first step of being a caregiver is you need to know about 
        some knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness. 
        When you become more knowledgeable, then you can only be a caregiver 
        who gives the right and suitable support.</p>

        <h3>Taking care of family member</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Mental health condition does not only affect an individual, and also their 
            family members. Support and accompanying family members can make a huge 
            difference. Although you might face a lot of problems, remember you are 
            not alone and also in the process of learning. <br>
            It is hard to control every situation that might arise, and there must be some 
            situations you will feel difficult or even want to give up. Remember, 
            you are still learning. </p>

        <h3>Things you can do</h3>

        <ul class="to-do">
            <li>Become knowledgeable in mental health, especially your family memberâ€™s condition.</li>
            <li>Encourage family members to involve in treatment and follow the treatment plan.</li>
            <li>Be a good listener.</li>
            <li>Don't fight alone, find support.</li>
            <li>Take care of family members and yourself</li>

        <p>
            It may be stressful when you are in the process of taking 
            care of your family members. Thus, you need to 
            take care of yourself since you will be providing long-term
            care for your family members. You also can find coworkers 
            for further help. Again, you are not alone in helping 
            your love.
